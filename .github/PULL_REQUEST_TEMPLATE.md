<!--

If this PR should trigger a release, make sure your title is prefixed with one of these:

- fix: (patch release)
- feat: (minor release)

These can be used but will not trigger a release:

build: | chore: | ci: | docs: | style: | refactor: | perf: | test:

To trigger a major release, add ! to the prefix. Any prefix can do this, e.g.:

- refactor!: drop support for Node 6
- fix!: remove old conflicting method
